# ECSE 543

This holds my assignment submissions for McGill University's course ECSE 543
Numerical Methods in Electrical Engineering.

## Reports
Reports were generated using `Pandoc` with the following command:

```bash
pandoc report.md -o report.pdf --filter pandoc-crossref --pdf-engine=xelatex
```

The `pandoc-crossref` filter is needed.

## Disclaimer
This likely contains mistakes as these assignments were rushed (especially
assignment 1), and some notes were added to note where points were lost. Use
with caution.
